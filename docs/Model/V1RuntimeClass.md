## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**api_version** | **string** | APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources | [optional]
**handler** | **string** | handler specifies the underlying runtime and configuration that the CRI implementation will use to handle pods of this class. The possible values are specific to the node &amp; CRI configuration.  It is assumed that all handlers are available on every node, and handlers of the same name are equivalent on every node. For example, a handler called \&quot;runc\&quot; might specify that the runc OCI runtime (using native Linux containers) will be used to run the containers in a pod. The Handler must be lowercase, conform to the DNS Label (RFC 1123) requirements, and is immutable. |
**kind** | **string** | Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds | [optional]
**metadata** | [**\Kubernetes\Client\Model\V1ObjectMeta**](V1ObjectMeta.md) |  | [optional]
**overhead** | [**\Kubernetes\Client\Model\V1Overhead**](V1Overhead.md) |  | [optional]
**scheduling** | [**\Kubernetes\Client\Model\V1Scheduling**](V1Scheduling.md) |  | [optional]
