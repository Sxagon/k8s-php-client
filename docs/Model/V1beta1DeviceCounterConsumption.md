# V1beta1DeviceCounterConsumption

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**compatibility_groups** | **string[]** | CompatibilityGroups is a list of opaque group names for this counter set consumption.  Devices that consume counters from the same counter set may only be allocated at the same time (\&quot;co-allocated\&quot;) if they all share at least one common group: the intersection of the CompatibilityGroups of all co-allocated devices on that counter set must be non-empty. Devices that consume from different counter sets are never compared via this field.  An unset field, an explicit nil, and an empty list are equivalent and mean \&quot;no groups\&quot;: such a device is only co-allocatable with sibling devices on the same counter set that also have no groups, and is never co-allocatable with a device that declares one or more groups.  Group names are opaque and meaningful only within the publishing driver&#39;s pool.  The maximum number of groups is 2, and the names must be unique. | [optional]
**counter_set** | **string** | CounterSet is the name of the set from which the counters defined will be consumed. |
**counters** | [**array<string,\Kubernetes\Client\Model\V1beta1Counter>**](V1beta1Counter.md) | Counters defines the counters that will be consumed by the device.  The maximum number of counters is 32. |
