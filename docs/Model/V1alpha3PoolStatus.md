# V1alpha3PoolStatus

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**allocated_devices** | **int** | AllocatedDevices is the number of devices currently allocated to claims. A value of 0 means no devices are allocated. May be unset when validationError is set. | [optional]
**available_devices** | **int** | AvailableDevices is the number of devices available for allocation. This equals TotalDevices - AllocatedDevices - UnavailableDevices. A value of 0 means no devices are currently available. May be unset when validationError is set. | [optional]
**driver** | **string** | Driver is the DRA driver name for this pool. Must be a DNS subdomain (e.g., \&quot;gpu.example.com\&quot;). |
**generation** | **int** | Generation is the pool generation observed across all ResourceSlices in this pool. Only the latest generation is reported. During a generation rollout, if not all slices at the latest generation have been published, the pool is included with a validationError and device counts unset. |
**node_name** | **string** | NodeName is the node this pool is associated with. When omitted, the pool is not associated with a specific node. Must be a valid DNS subdomain name (RFC1123). | [optional]
**partition_summary** | [**\Kubernetes\Client\Model\V1alpha3PartitionTypeStatus[]**](V1alpha3PartitionTypeStatus.md) | PartitionSummary reports allocatability per (attribute, partition type) for a partitionable pool that publishes SharedCounters. Each entry names the grouping attribute it was resolved from: the PartitionTypeAttribute declared by a device&#39;s own slice, or for devices whose slice declares none, the default named in the request. A pool that mixes partitions declared under different attributes reports each independently. When no slice declares an attribute and the request names no default, the pool reports no partition summary. | [optional]
**pool_name** | **string** | PoolName is the name of the pool. Must be a valid resource pool name (DNS subdomains separated by \&quot;/\&quot;). |
**resource_slice_count** | **int** | ResourceSliceCount is the number of ResourceSlices that make up this pool. May be unset when validationError is set. | [optional]
**shareable_summary** | [**\Kubernetes\Client\Model\V1alpha3ShareableSummaryStatus**](V1alpha3ShareableSummaryStatus.md) |  | [optional]
**total_devices** | **int** | TotalDevices is the total number of devices in the pool across all slices. A value of 0 means the pool has no devices. May be unset when validationError is set. | [optional]
**unavailable_devices** | **int** | UnavailableDevices is the number of devices that are not available due to taints or other conditions, but are not allocated. A value of 0 means all unallocated devices are available. May be unset when validationError is set. | [optional]
**validation_error** | **string** | ValidationError is set when the pool&#39;s data could not be fully validated (e.g., incomplete slice publication). When set, device count fields and ResourceSliceCount may be unset. | [optional]
